# RL‑Sim Roadmap — Reinforcement Learning Simulation
## Purpose
Demonstrate reward learning, prediction error, and symptom-linked modeling.

## Phase 1
- Implement 2-choice bandit. (Volatile vs. stable schedules landed Nov 13, 2025.)
- Add basic parameter recovery.
- Tag v0.3 release.

## Phase 2
- Simulate severity-based group differences. (Helper landed Nov 13, 2025.)
- Write short simulation paper (OSF).
- Add visualization module.
- Tag v1.0.

## Phase 3
- Record YouTube walkthrough.
- Integrate with MPAL severity outputs.

## Phase 4
- Use RL‑Sim as interview demo.
